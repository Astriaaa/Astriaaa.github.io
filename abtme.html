                <p>I was born on April 26, 2003, in Bulusukan, San Ildefonso, Bulacan. I was the oldest of the three children. I'm a Student here at Baliuag University. Im a freshman here. <br><br>
                    When I was young, I moved with my family here to our relative's house in Pinoad, San Ildefonso, Bulacan. My earliest memories are here in this house. My parents work is as housewives and Farm managers. My parents have been working here for more than 20 years. Here at Pinoad, San Ildefonso, Bulacan, I received my nursery in Human Potential degree. In Tarcan, Baliwag, Bulacan, I received my elementary school diploma from Baliuag Alliance Christian Academy. I attended Montessori De San Ildefonso in San Juan, San Ildefonso, Bulacan, for grade 8 while I was in high school after studying grade 7 at Baliuag Alliance Christian Academy. There, I graduated after continuing my education. I attended Gil Carlos Street, Baliwag City, Bulacan's Baliwag University, during my last year of high school. Baliwag University was where I began my college career.
                     When I was in grade 9, I worked as a sales associate at Frontrow to help my parents with our daily needs. I became more passionate about it,
                     and I worked harder, but suddenly I lost focus because my priority was to study. I want to work on my own because sometimes I donâ€™t want to rely on my parents;
                     I just want to have my own money to help them and pay for what they do to me. <br><br>
                    My goal in life is to have a college degree. I&#39; m currently studying Information Technology at Baliwag University. I gain more knowledge here at my school; they help me a lot. I really like this course, so I will work harder to achieve it, as it says in a bible verse, "nothing will be impossible with God." Luke 1:37 says that if you are with God, you will overcome everything you face. You just have to trust him. So, in everything we do, we will always include the Lord so that everything can be done correctly and properly. I will improve my studies for my parents, who are struggling, so that we can study as siblings. And so that I can repay their hardships in life. <br><br>
                    Within the boundaries of San Ildefonso, I play basketball. For our place, we are battling in several locations. Our site has been raised. On April 13, 2018, we fought there. Luckily, we lost, but we still gained a lot of knowledge. The Ateneo athletes also came to the municipality of San Ildefonso on May 13 to meet with us. We beat them there, and now they're seeking people who can play in Manila because of the victory. I was unexpectedly passed over for the Manila team. I put more effort into my training after learning that I wasn't selected in order to get chosen the next time. These days, the other barangays pay me to play with them. <br> <br>
                    This year has been difficult for me because I found out that my grandmother has cancer. I don't really think that he will have cancer because of his situation. You can't say that he is sick. After we found out that my grandmother had cancer, we quickly consulted the doctor about how we could prevent it. The doctor said he needed to be operated on. and when he said that, we quickly scheduled an operation for my grandmother. I think this is the most difficult thing in my life. I was scared when my grandmother was in the operating room. I didn't know what to do at that time. I'm afraid of what can happen. He was in the operating room for almost 6 hours, so my chest was very nervous. but by God's mercy, my grandmother's operation was successful. until he gets home.
                    I was planning to build a business when I finished my college life. I am planning a studio business because I think many people will enjoy this studio because people today will like to make memorable memories. Nowadays, many people go to photo shops to take pictures. But what I am planning here in my studio is for them to have a photoshoot by themselves. They can get their picture by scanning the QR code. Also, I&#39;m planning to build a coffee shop.
